# Overview
This package is forked from the old `@union/forms` npm package that is no longer maintained, and no one knows where it exists.

It has been updated to accomodate Dart Sass and newer Node.js features.

This package will not accept pull requests. It is only used for compatibility with some of our long-running projects.

This package previously depended on `@union/global` - It now depends on `@union/global-legacy`

## Installation
New package name `@union/forms-legacy`
